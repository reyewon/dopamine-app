# Dopamine: An AI-Powered Command Center

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio, designed as a sophisticated management tool for creative professionals.

## The Vision

The goal is to create an application that is not only functional but also a joy to use. The core philosophy is to **reduce friction and administrative overhead** through smart, AI-powered automation, allowing the user to stay focused on creative work.

### Guiding Principles

1.  **Effortless Workflow Automation**: The central "Magic Input" feature uses natural language processing to intelligently parse high-level requests into structured data (projects or shoots), eliminating the need for manual form entry.

2.  **A Calm, Bespoke Aesthetic**: The UI follows a unique design language characterized by warm, off-white backgrounds, a distinctive burnt-orange primary color, and clean, spacious layouts. This creates a calming and premium user experience.

3.  **Actionable Business Insights**: The app integrates key business metrics, such as a revenue dashboard, directly into the workflow. This provides an at-a-glance overview of financial health to support better business decisions.

4.  **Context-Specific Organization**: The application is separated into two primary views:
    *   **Projects**: For managing internal, multi-step goals and their associated tasks.
    *   **Shoots**: For managing specific, client-facing jobs with dedicated metadata like client details, location, price, and progress tracking.
